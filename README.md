is to create a version capable of targeting multiple platforms & frameworks with minimal
depenencies, but still provide a flexible & high performance CMS library.

Piranha is currently built for `NetStandard 2.0` and uses the following awesome packages:

* AutoMapper `6.2.1`
* Markdig `0.14.6`
* Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore `2.0.1`
* Newtonsoft.Json `10.0.3`

## Core Packages
